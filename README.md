# Account-Log-In

This program simulates a returning user logging into their account. Alternatively, it allows a new user to register for an account. The code 
checks the password against a custom regular expression to increase the password strength. The code also implements an interface that has a set of methods that 
are required to be overwritten for the program to function. Furthermore, for demonstration purposes, at the end of the program it allows the user to 
see all the stored usernames and passwords. Source code can be examined on my GitHub.
